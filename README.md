Project 1:- 

Language Identification: 

•Worked on the NLP problem of Language Identification having a dataset consisting of 6,872,356 sentences and 328 unique languages to identify.

•Performed preprocessing on the large dataset of sentences and converted them to character-n grams to reduce the feature space and provide inputs to the Neural Networks as well as the models.

•Attempted to solve this NLP problem using a variety of methods including Naïve Bayes (giving accuracy-83.6%), Neural networks (accuracy-97.21%), and the BERT Multilingual base model(accuracy-99.2%).
